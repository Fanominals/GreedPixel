#This was created by Niall for selling on MC-Market. DO NOT redistribute it. 

#Agreement
#By purchasing this resource, "Professional Custom Essentials Messages (Easily customisable!)”, you, the customer, agree to this agreement and all terms stated within it. You will not distribute or resell this resource. You may only utilise this file for one server that you own. If you wish to use it for multiple different servers, you have to purchase it again. You may not use this file for service purposes, this includes, but is not limited to Minecraft server setup teams or businesses, server hosting services and the like. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not purchase this resource. These terms are subject to change at the sole discretion of Niall (http://www.mc-market.org/members/22101/).

#Customise: 
#To customise the messages, use a find and replace tool present in applications like Notepad and Notepad++ and find the messages below and replace  them with whatever you desire. Make sure when you replace, you use REPLACE ALL. "Control + F" is generally how you will get the find tool. e.g. You can change the general message prefix by finding "\u00a7\u00a7lSERVER \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB " and replacing all instances with "\u00a73\u00a7lCool\u00a7f\u00a7lCraft \u00a7r\u00a78> ".
#Note: Colour codes are changed by "\u00a7(colour code)". Replace the (colour code) section with whatever colour code you want. e.g. You could change the default colour of the "SERVER" prefix text from the &3 dark aqua colour, to the &b aqua colour by changing the prefix from "\u00A7b\u00a7lGreed\u00A7a\u00a7lPixel \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB " to "\u00a7b\u00a7lSERVER \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB ". 
#Note: When replacing, make sure you use everything within the quotation marks for the prefix you want to change stated below. This includes the text, colour codes and final space.
#Note: In the orginal prefixes "\u00BB" is the double arrows in the prefix. Feel free to change this if you wish. e.g. You can change the double arrows in the prefix to '>' if you wanted.
#Note: You can disable messages by leaving them blank. e.g. "action="
#If you have any questions or concerns - contact Niall on MC-Market.

#Variables to replace/customise/edit:
#Default text colour of messages: "\u00a77"
#General messages prefix: "\u00A7b\u00a7lGreed\u00A7a\u00a7lPixel \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB "*To change just the server name, replace only "SERVER".
#Mail messages prefix: "\u00a7e\u00a7lMAIL \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB "
#Staff related messages prefix: "\u00a7c\u00a7lSTAFF \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB "
#Nickname related messages prefix: "\u00a7d\u00a7lNICKNAME \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB "
#Kit related messages prefix: "\u00a7a\u00a7lKITS \u00a7r\u00a78\u00BB "
#/msg, /me and /broadcast text formating colour: "\u00a7b"
#Note: If you have any suggestions of variables to add, contact Niall on MC-Market.
