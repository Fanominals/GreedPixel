# How many ticks should the plugin wait before loading data (voidchests, player related data, etc)
#
# This should only be modified if servers are having issues with worlds loading after the voidchest plugin has loaded.
# Recommended load-delay interval is any number from 1 to 10, the highest, the more time the data will delay to load.
# 
# Any number that is < 1 will make the plugin instantly load data when the plugin enabled as well.
